# .config

My .config or the highway

## zsh expectation

[Oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) has pretty decent defaults.
On the receiver end, ~/.zshrc is symlinked to this/zsh/.zshrc.

## nvim expectation

All the prerequisites so that [I can kickstart neovim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)
